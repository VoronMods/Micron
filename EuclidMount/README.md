# Euclid mount for Micron

## Attention: 
you can't use the same script as Klicky probe, to catch the Euclid probe, you need to approach the dock from the front and do it slow on the last
10-20mm down, don't let the magnets "bang" as you may break them.
To release the probe, you approach the dock from the side and release going forwards (positive X direction)

Gantry mount is the same, probe dock and X carriage mount is new design.
Mostly done but still work in progress.

## Not tested yet, Micron build in progress.

Screws to mount the Dock to the Gantry mount:
2x M3x10

To do: 
- find the best print orientation for probe dock and add built-in supports
- add cover for dock
